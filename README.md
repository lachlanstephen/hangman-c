<h1>Hangman in C</h1>

<p>Decided to learn about receiving input from the standard input, and thought Hangman would be a great way of doing so.</p>

<h3>Compiling the program</h3>

<p>Run the following commands:</p>

```
make

./play-hangman
```

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>How to play my program:</p>

<ol>
<li>Player 1 types a lowercase alphabetical word as the secret, and hits 'enter'.</li>
<li>Player 2 then takes turns, either guessing one letter at a time, attempting to complete the word</li>
<li>If the player completes the word before losing all their lives, they WIN! Otherwise, game over :'(</li>
</ol>

<h3>Plans for project</h3>

[] <p>Add output of guesses player has already taken</p>
[] <p>Add ascii art of hangman</p>

<p>ENJOY :)</p>
